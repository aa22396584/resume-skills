# Release CI/CD and claim checklist

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is the release authority. A configured workflow
alone is not evidence that a release ran; each published version needs its own
archived run and immutable commit.

## One-time repository setup

1. Protect `main`; require the `ci` workflow before merge. Add an immutable tag
   ruleset for `v*` that blocks updates and deletion after tag creation.
2. Create a GitHub environment named **`pypi`** and add appropriate reviewer/protection rules.
3. In PyPI, create a Trusted Publisher for this repository, workflow file `release.yml`, environment `pypi`, and project `portable-resume`.
4. Keep Actions permissions restricted; the workflow grants write/OIDC permissions only to the jobs that need them.
5. Maintain the independent
   [`portable-resume-marketplace`](https://github.com/ImL1s/portable-resume-marketplace).
   Its CI validates every change; scheduled, manual, and repository-dispatch
   workflows synchronize stable source releases.

No long-lived PyPI token is required or expected.

Current repository-policy evidence (2026-08-01): active
[ruleset `20148806`](https://github.com/ImL1s/resume-skills/rules/20148806)
targets `refs/tags/v*`, blocks updates and deletion, and reports an empty bypass
actor list through the repository rulesets API. This satisfies the one-time tag
policy setup; changing or removing the ruleset is a separate administrative
action and must never be presented as an allowed tag mutation path.

## Pre-release

The version lifecycle is fail-closed:

1. After publishing `vX.Y.Z`, immediately advance `main` to the next intended
   `X.Y.Z.dev0` or minor-development version.
2. Development builds retain that PEP 440 base. Explicit build/release reports
   expose commit/dirty/registry provenance through
   `portable-resume/build-identity-v2`. Version 2 adds the required non-package
   build-input digest. Runtime inspection remains compatible with canonical v1
   documents, but artifact-producing and verification paths require v2. Build
   tooling pins one canonical document plus its SHA-256 before byte production
   and embeds the exact bytes into every Python and host-package artifact.
   Installed runtime identity lookup uses only
   the fixed packaged resource, never the build-pin environment and never Git;
   an unpackaged source checkout uses the documented null-commit fallback. This
   does not change the separate optional trusted-zstd reader boundary.
3. Prepare a release by replacing the development base with exact `X.Y.Z`,
   merging green CI, and only then creating the annotated matching tag.
4. The release workflow rejects `.devN`; after publication, repeat step 1 before
   any further product change.

```bash
python3 scripts/self_verify.py
python3 scripts/check_docs.py
python3 scripts/check_secrets.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/smoke_installed_matrix.py
python3 scripts/check_release.py --tag vX.Y.Z --json
python3 scripts/check_version_state.py --require-git --json
```

Update `portable_resume.__version__`, `pyproject.toml`, README, and CHANGELOG
together. The release candidate uses an exact stable version; `.devN` is never a
publishable tag. Commit a clean tree, merge to `main`, then create an
**annotated** tag:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

## Automated release order

1. Check out the requested tag with full history, validate it, and export its
   peeled 40-character commit SHA.
2. Require strict `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, matching source/package versions,
   CHANGELOG entry, clean tree, annotated tag, and reachability from
   `origin/main`; pin every downstream checkout to the validated commit SHA.
3. Run the four canonical gates plus multilingual-document consistency on Ubuntu/macOS × Python 3.11/3.14.
4. Pin one clean, exact-tag canonical build identity plus its SHA-256 before any
   artifact bytes are produced. The identity binds the runtime source,
   registries, and non-package artifact build inputs; set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
   from that commit.
5. Build wheel, sdist, one direct host archive per enabled destination
   (currently 18), and eight plugin/marketplace archives (including the
   plugin-root `codex-plugin` bundle) once from that pin.
6. Require every archive and the host report to contain the exact canonical
   identity bytes at its contracted runtime path, then smoke-install the exact
   wheel and sdist outside the checkout on both OSes with build-pin environment
   variables scrubbed.
7. Generate artifact digests, `release-evidence.json`, and a `SHA256SUMS` that
   uses the flat basenames delivered by GitHub Releases.
8. Recreate that flat download layout and verify every checksum on Ubuntu and
   macOS.
9. Create GitHub artifact attestations and a **draft** Release containing those exact bytes.
10. Reassert that the remote annotated tag still peels to the validated SHA,
   then publish the same Python artifacts through PyPI Trusted Publishing.
11. Reassert the remote tag again and publish the staged GitHub Release only
    after PyPI succeeds. A manual dispatch may deliberately skip PyPI. Protect
    `v*` tags with an immutable repository ruleset because workflow checks
    cannot make a mutable Git ref atomic.
12. Synchronize the public marketplace and verify its release:

    ```bash
    gh workflow run sync.yml \
      --repo ImL1s/portable-resume-marketplace \
      -f tag=vX.Y.Z
    ```

    The marketplace also polls daily and accepts the
    `portable-resume-release` repository-dispatch event.

## Manual recovery / dry release

`workflow_dispatch` accepts an existing annotated tag and `publish_pypi=false`. This validates and publishes the GitHub Release without PyPI. Re-running the same tag refreshes draft assets with `--clobber`; published version bytes must never be replaced on PyPI.

## Claim requirements

Archive all of the following in [`evidence-summary.md`](evidence-summary.md): exact tag and 40-character SHA, immutable Actions run URL, GitHub Release URL, PyPI version URL or explicit skip, successful OS jobs, and maintainer/date sign-off.

Host UI/picker, public marketplace, and vendor-curated directory claims remain
separate and require their own rows in
[`host-ui-smoke.md`](host-ui-smoke.md).

Separate v0.3.2-era local evidence verifies headless Skill invocation on eight
host CLI surfaces and exact local installation of all seven supported native
package formats, including Cursor. Pi native activation remains **not-run**.
This release workflow does not reproduce those credentialed host checks.
Separate v0.3.2 post-release evidence verifies public marketplace installation
on all six compatible hosts and Cursor/Kimi marketplace picker flows; fresh
through 0.4.1 host-by-host reinstall remains **not-run**. Sanitized readbacks are
retained in
[`evidence/public-marketplace-v0.3.2.json`](evidence/public-marketplace-v0.3.2.json).
Other visual Skill pickers, vendor-curated
Claude/Cursor directory listings, and Cursor full bubble-graph completeness
remain excluded. OpenAI Plugins Directory listing at 0.4.5 is recorded in
[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) / [`evidence-summary.md`](evidence-summary.md), not in
this release-workflow claim.
